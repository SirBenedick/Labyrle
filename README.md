During our four-day project management workshop, we were challenged to develop a small game for a specific customer.
Parts of the requirements were:
* The System has to be logically challenging.
* The System has to be playable on Windows.
* The System should be playable on all operating systems.
* The System should include a consistent design.
* The System should include multiple levels.

We developed a game concept and presented the paper mockup to our customer.
She liked the idea thus we began prototyping the core of your game. Iterating through constant customer feedback we developed following game and achived great customer satisfaction while learning a lot about project planning and project management.
